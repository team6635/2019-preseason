# vscode-testing
This is just some testing we are doing with Visual Studio Code, which is 
to be the IDE of choice for FRC starting in the 2019 season.

> We are also using this repository to begin testing and implementing our swerve drive code
> as well as other code for the upcoming season. You are free to use this code as you wish,
> just please attribute us if it helped you.
